-   The main of the presentation is to show different spatial statistical tools to deal with the air control pollution, specifically NOx and PM10 in the city of Madrid and to show some regional implications.

-   I have divided the presentation int 3 parts.

-   First, I'm going to speak from the point of view of spatial and spatio-temporal kriging.

-   Second, we deal with functional kriging.

-   Third, we import methodology from quantitative finance to environmetal field.

:::

::: notes
Regarding to the first part, the first question is: where does geostatistics arise?

-   Geostatistics arise in 1951, in gold mine in South Africa, with the Phd of Danie G. Krige, who presented his pioneering plotter of distance-weighted average gold grades.

-   Later, in 1960, prof. Matheron develop the theoretical basis of the methods proposed by krige and coined the term of KRIGING in honor of prof. Krige.

## The idea of kriging {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Intuitive idea

![](img/fig_lambdas.jpg){width="50%"}

### Theoretical background

Predict the value $Z^\ast (\bf s)$ at the location $\bf s_0$ by $Z^\ast ({\bf s}_0) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\lambda _i Z(\bf s_i )}$ based on the given values $Z_{\bf s_1},Z_{\bf s_2},\ldots,Z_{\bf s_n}$.

The **Kriging weights** $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ are determined so that the expected squared interpolation error \begin{equation*}
E((Z^\ast ({\bf s_0})- Z({\bf s_0}))^2) \quad DEPENDS\ ON  \ SEMIVARIOGRAM !!
\end{equation*} is minimized over all choices of $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_N$.

**Ordinary Kriging**:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
 \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {\lambda _j \gamma ({\bf s}_i - {\bf s}_j) + \alpha = 
 \gamma ({\rm {\bf s}}_i - {\bf s}_0 ),\forall i = 1,...,n} \\
 \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\lambda _i = 1} \; \\
   \end{array}} \right.
\end{equation*}
```
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
**Semivariogram**: $\gamma ({\rm{\bf h}}) = \frac{1}{2}V\left[ {Z({\bf s} + {\bf h}) - Z({\bf s})}\right] \quad *** key *** !!$

Madrid has a Low Emission Zone called LEZ

-   January 2022 (inside the ring road M-30).

-   January 2023 (inside and the ring road M-30).

What happen with other areas (USERA, PLAZA ELÍPTICA)?

1.  Madrid Central

2.  **Madrid 360 (December 2021): covers the Downtown area and the Plaza Elíptica area.**
:::
:::

::: notes
What are the regional implications for the city of Madrid of this study?

We can see that the definition of Madrid low zone emisions change over time.

-   Fist, the target was the area inside the ring road M-30,

-   Then, inside and the ring road.

But, what happe with this area?

Now, the political goberment focus on Madrid 360: downtown and usera + plaza elíptica.

Functional kriging prediction of atmospheric particulate matter concentrations in Madrid, Spain: Is the new monitoring system masking potential public health problems?

J.M. Montero, G. Fernández-Avilés
:::

![](img/plot-jcp.png)

::: notes
The second part of the presentation is in the line of geostatistics, in this case, functional geostatistics.

The study solve an important question. After the reorganization of MS in 2009, are the MS in the most polluted sites?

We predict the PM10 series in the places where the MS with the highest potential concentration of PM10 were removed and in areas heavily traveled by the population.
:::

## What happen? {.smaller}

In 2010, the city's atmospheric pollution monitoring system was reorganized and ecologist associations suspected that the Municipality of Madrid removed stations from the sites that were potentially the most polluted.

In FOK strategy, the predicted curve is a linear combination of the observed curves in other locations. Curves are obtined used B-splines.

$$\chi_{s_0} =\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i  \chi_{s_i}$$ We obtain also:

-   **functional kiriging ecuations**,

-   **prediction varianza** and

-   the **trace-semivariogram** (the keystonelike semivariogram in kriging case).

We predicted PM10 functional data for the period 2010--2015 at the sites where the MS were eliminated from the system and compared them with the functional concentrations corresponding to the sites where the MS are currently located, in order to either confirm or reject the suspicions of the ecologist groups.

-   We join the debate on the air pollutant that is most damaging to human health, PM10.

-   Our results indicate that the means (also volatility, skewness and kurtosis) of the functional concentrations of PM10 in the new locations of the MS are similar to corresponding values predicted at the sites where the MS were removed from the system.

-   According to our results, city of Madrid's new APMS fulfills the requirements established by Directive 2008/50/EC.

An extended CAViaR model for early-warning of exceedances of the air pollution standards. The case of PM10 in the city of Madrid.

L. Sanchis-Marco, J.M. Montero, G. Fernández-Avilés
:::

![](img/plot-caviar.png)

::: notes
In this case, our main aim it to provide predictions of PM10 using and extend CAViaR model, that is, a very useful type of modeling in fiance.

We extend the model with meteorological covariables like wind direction, rainfalls, {mean, max, average} temperature...

BUT, like the computation only alows to include one more variable in the model, we create a Meteorological Condition Indicator with PCA
:::

## The model: extended CAViAR {.smaller}

$$VaR_{\lambda, t}= \beta_{\lambda, 0} +\beta_{\lambda, 1}VaR_{\lambda, t-1} + \beta_{\lambda, 2} |r_{t-1}| + \beta^{*}_\lambda f(X_{t-1}) + e_{\lambda, t}  $$

-   autorregressive non lineal model
-   estimated by quantile regression
-   with meteorological covariables

## The case study: Madrid

![](img/pm10-covariables.png)

-   Meteorological conditions indicator (MCI) was constructed by principal component analysis (PCA).

## The results

We compare the following models (in-sample and out-sample)

CAViaR

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Extended CAViaR
:::

EWMA

Garch(1,1)

EVTM-BM

::: notes
-   Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk

-   Extended Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk

We not only compare the relative performance of the extended CAViaR against the standard CAViaR, but also against several established parametric and semi-parametric strategies that are based solely on returns, such a:

-   Exponentially Weighted Moving Average

-   the gaussian GARCH model (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity)

-   Model that combines GARCH estimation with the block-maxima approach of the Extrem Value Theory
:::

## Regional implications {.smaller background-color="black"}

-   Our CAViaR approach provides citizens and competent municipal authorities with a set of VaR values (one-day-ahead relative increases of PM10 concentration) and their respective probabilities.

**By the way of example:**

-   In the case that today's PM10 average is 40 $μg/m3$ and the forecast for the one-day-ahead $10%VaR$ is 0.32%, there is a probability of $10%$ that the PM10 concentration tomorrow is at least 40 × 1.32 = 52.8 μg/m3, thus exceeding both the EU standard and the WHO guideline.

-   It is the municipal environmental authorities that must decide with political-economic-health criteria, which indicate their aversion to risk, whether or not to take any remedial measure and, if so, what measures to take.
